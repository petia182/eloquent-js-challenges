// 1. Looping a triangle

/* Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
It may be useful to know that you can find the length of a string by writing .length after it.

let abc = "abc";
console.log(abc.length);
// → 3
Most exercises contain a piece of code that you can modify to solve the exercise. Remember that you can click code blocks to edit them.

for (let counter = '#'; counter.length <= 7; counter += '#') {
  console.log(counter);
}

// 2 FizzBuzz

for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
    console.log('FizzBuzz')
  } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
    console.log('Fizz');
  } else if (i % 5 === 0 && i % 3 !== 0) {
    console.log('Buzz');
  } else {
    console.log(i);
  }
}

// 3 Chessboard
/*
Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #
When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.
